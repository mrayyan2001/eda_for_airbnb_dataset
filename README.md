This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings in a selected city to uncover trends in factors such as price, availability, location, and property type, using Python tools and libraries. The analysis will include thorough data cleaning, advanced visualizations, and statistical validation. Insights will be used to provide a comprehensive market overview and informed business recommendations.
